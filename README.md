# The-Game-Locker

A Java 11 web application with a backend build with Spring Boot and a frontend
supported by the Angular framework. The application will use AWS RDS instance of a postgresql database

The main purpose of this application to help with futhering my growth as a Java
developer. The secondary is that it will give me an application where I can track
where I place where I will be able to track my progress for the games I enjoy.
